<h2>Task1 : check if a number is even or odd</h2>
Here i am taking an int as the input from the user and in the if condition the remainder of the number when divided by 2 is found using the % opereator and we see wether it is equal to 0 using the == operator if the condition satisfies then the if block is made to run which says that the number is even if not then the else block is made to run.
